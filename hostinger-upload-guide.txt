HOSTINGER DEPLOYMENT STEPS FOR TECHTORNIX.COM

=== STEP 1: BUILD FRONTEND ===
1. Run: build-and-deploy.bat (or manually run 'npm run build' in frontend folder)
2. This creates a 'build' folder with all production files

=== STEP 2: UPLOAD TO HOSTINGER ===
1. Login to Hostinger Control Panel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to public_html folder
4. DELETE any existing files in public_html (if this is first deployment)
5. Upload ALL contents from 'frontend/build' folder to public_html:
   - index.html
   - static/ folder (contains CSS, JS, images)
   - manifest.json
   - favicon.ico
   - robots.txt
   - Any other files from build folder

6. Upload the .htaccess file from frontend folder to public_html root

=== STEP 3: BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (Railway) ===
1. Go to railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo
4. Select backend folder
5. Set Environment Variables:
   - MONGODB_URI: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/techtornix
   - JWT_SECRET: your-super-secret-jwt-key-12345
   - NODE_ENV: production
   - CLIENT_URL: https://techtornix.com
   - PORT: 5000

6. Copy your Railway backend URL (e.g., https://techtornix-backend.railway.app)

2. Rebuild frontend: npm run build
